            <h1>Design & Visualisation</h1>

            <p>My first designing experience was creating my first website about an assigned art style. I was introduced into colours, typography, design principles and layouts. I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for the first time. This very first theme also taught me the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>The first group project in the semester concerned redesign of existing website. As a person responsible for coding, I improved my knowledge about CSS grids and created a new website based on sketches from the other members of the group. Adding to that, I restructured content of the website. Bellow, I show the comparision of the old and the redesigned homepage as well as the link to the whole new website.</p>

            <p>Theme 2 - animation - gave me an opportunity to improve my drawing skills in Illustrator as well as to learn the basics of JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp. By creating simple animation and Project Pool exercises, I learned how this programming language can be useful in web design. </p>

            <p>The next large group assignment was interactive production.  I was responsible for User Experience, however, I also took an active part in creating a storyline, storyboard, and some graphics in the specific, given style. This theme also taught me how to make a good research and find inspiration online.</p>

            <p>During Theme 3 I was introduced to storytelling, work with sound, light, image composition and Adobe Premiere. I learned the importance of composition in relation to film making. In the first group project we were supposed to tell a story without words, based on proper editing and music selection. In second group project we supported Kobenhavns Kommune in the promotion of safe behaviors while cycling.<br>In the first project I was co-responsible for film editing. In the second I co-created the website and had a part in creating the storyline.</p>

            <p>The last and the longest group assignment was about inventing and developing the app. As a group member I participated in the design creation process. Moreover, I co-created the website promoting our product. My knowledge from the previous themes helped me to design simple and intuitive website's interface.</p>
